### FreeIPA

While there is no additional setup for FreeIPA, I recommend browsing through the options that can be set within FreeIPA. This includes the groups and users. This will be your primary management tool for users within your domain.

There are two accounts "admin" and the user you setup during install. Both passwords are the same after install. It is highly recommended that the admin password be made complex and different from any other user. In case of emergency, this admin user can be used to make necessary changes.
