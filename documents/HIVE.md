### TheHive and Cortex install

The Hive and Cortex are powerful incident tracking software used for communication between SOC team members. It is the best incident tracking software I have found for a small SOC team that is also free (free as in free beer).

That said, it has among the weirdest authentication system of any application.

Note TheHive and Cortex have their own hidden elastic cluster. It is at 172.19.0.111 and 172.19.0.113. This is because they require version 5.6.16 (a very old version).

For more information on managing this, I recommend you read their documentation:
