### Servers

There is no additional setup required for your CentOS/RedHat server, but I thought I'd mention that there is no root access anymore. You may still use your original administrator account or you can use your new IPA user account. The first user is given administrator privileges.

All admins in IPA can use sudo on servers, in case you need to modify a setting or something that requires root. Note: Single Sign on enforcement allows you to track changes made by individual users instead of one conglomeration of a 'root' account.
